- Fix the ui, currently it is fixed sized, it is this way because I did not learn how to make the interfce 'adapt'.

- The delete part grid should have a 'X' icon, clickin this icon removes the part

- Make a function that shows how much was bought/sold in a given time frame

- Make a screen that summs the value of the parts in all the stock (table Stok).

- Implement a configuration file which will contain eg. database access credentials.

- Add a daily resume wich will show:
        Not Finished Services;
        Not Paid Services;

- Add a function on wich owner can set a date on which the client is going to pick his car.
        List clients that will come today to get his Car.

- Register Workshop workers(mitarbeiters).
- Create a second client with a simple interface, maybe qwidget. This screen will appear in tvs
allong the workshop, it will show open services and who is working on which one.

--NEW IDEAS 23-02-17--
currently when the owner selects a service it will at the same time register the hour cost on that service, remove that.

And improve:

In the service have an open and closed flag;
If open show who opened it (employee opened/working on it)

Resume:
Service is 'closed' or 'open'

when owner selects 'open'  he can set a personal hour cost (system will show the cost reguistered currently)

If user is system root he can 'assign' the task to some employee.

Oficina clients show always display that info.

IN PROGRESS:
- Make a screen that summs the value of the parts in all the stock (table Stok).

BUGS:
Adding a part is not removing from stock.

DONE:
- Change QPushButton's to QDialogButtonBox as QDialogButtonBox seems to suit better and has built-in icons.
