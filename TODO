----

src code improvements:
In the service have an open and closed flag; (what? this is already applied, double check).


REJECTED:
- Register Workshop workers(mitarbeiters).
- If open show who opened it (employee opened/working on it);
-----


IN PROGRESS:
- Make a screen that summs the value of the parts in all the stock (table Stok).
- Make a function that shows how much was bought/sold in a given time frame(ome only
one parts and another parts + handwork).
- When searching use a qsqltable proxy and make the search dropdown work nativelly (dropping data from the proxy and not making a select in the database).
- Stock total value on stock control UI

BUGS:
Adding a part is not removing from stock.

TODOS:
In the Add part do stock form there is a combo which enables to add the part to a part group;
In the add service where we create the initial order there is a dropdown which sould list some `default` services description, this is only in the form;

---------

DONE:
- Change QPushButton's to QDialogButtonBox as QDialogButtonBox seems to suit better and has built-in icons.

- Fix the ui, currently it is fixed sized, it is this way because I did not learn how to make the interfce 'adapt'.

- When searching use a qsqltable proxy and make the search dropdown work nativelly (dropping data from the proxy and not making a select in the database).
    done for clients

- Make hours cost editable by service (not all services have the same level of dificulty so prices change)

Prio:
Store user preferences (eg. maximized, last window size...)
