- Fix the ui, currently it is fixed sized, it is this way because I did not learn how to make the interfce 'adapt'
- The delete part grid should have a 'X' icon, clickin this icon removes the part
- Make a function that shows how much was bought/sold in a given time frame
- Make a screen that summs the value os the parts in all the stock (table Stok)
- Implement a configuration file which will contain eg. database access credentials

- Add a daily resume wich will show:
	Not Finished Services;
	Not Paid Services;

- Add a function on wich owner can set a date on which the client is going to pick his car.
 	List clients that will come today to get is Car.
